Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch in a Jupyter Notebook, then convert it into a command line application.

### See Results.md for sample runs of the program

**Note**: All file paths must be relative when using the command line scripts.
